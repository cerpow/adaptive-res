# AdaptiveRes

AdaptiveRes adapts your resolution to maintain a stable FPS.

## About

Since BFA was introduced, Blizzard removed the "Fullscreen" option and switched to Render Scale to switch your resolution in-game. This adds the option to adapt your resolution if your FPS drops into a certain area caused by mist, fog or particles. AdaptiveResÂ will decrease the resolution until it reached the specified frame-rate by user and increase it back after a time delay.

## How to use

AdaptiveRes is automatically enabled and will adapt your resolution using the default settings.

- /adaptiveres to open the config panel
- Right click on Stats Indicator to open the config panel
- To move the Stats Indicator, hold down SHIFT then drag to a new position.

## Known Issues

Random hickups may occur.

## Recommended Settings

- Turn ON V-sync in graphics settings
- Turn OFF Max Background FPS (so render scale will not drop if you alt-tab)(optional).
- Set your 'FPS to adapt' to your monitor refresh rate (usually it's 60hz, 120hz, 144hz, etc).
